The Technician Rock Paper Scissors Auto-Player V2
Optimizing the fun out of it since 2020

Notes: 
It seems that you can get rate-limited ocassionally
(API sends blank response)
All data was gathered from http://gangadiddle.com/rps.js


Made by OutRite

For information into how the API works (to port this to
your favorite programming language!)
Read API_docs.txt

if you want to contribute, go to the JS file linked above
and do some analysis or whatever and fix API_docs.txt

Fun fact:

Since RNG generally starts to repeat itself (run a couple
iterations of a random number 0-2 in your favorite language)
we can "exploit" this to increase our accuracy with only
a couple extra lines of code (the main feature of V2!)

oh yeah btw we were mentioned by mr. technician himself
