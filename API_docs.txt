Unofficial gangadiddle.com Rock Paper Scissors API documentation

1. Basics

all data is sent and received through a JSON object, for example

{'magicNo': 2036397594}

this is only a slight inconvenience for us, since
we're using python, not JS, though python
has built-in support for JSON objects as it is, so it doesn't
matter much.
Most of the JSON strings included here actually have a more
descriptive userMsg, but we really don't care about that except
for debugging purposes.

2. Happy Funtime Magic Numbers

Happy Funtime Magic Numbers (referred to here as HFMNs)
are IDs that are used to tell the server which snapchat
video/image we want to download or get from the archive.
Here's an example:

2036397594

We send this data through the magicNo parameter.

3. HFMN check

We can send the API a simple JSON string with the
magicNo parameter and the HFMN to receive one of three
things:

1: {'responseCode': 3, 'rpsSession': '[this is a session id]'}
This simply means that was valid, and we use rpsSession to send
the API our moves. This ID can expire.

2: {'responseCode': 5}
This means that the HFMN we sent it doesn't actually exist.

3: {'responseCode': 6}
This means we didn't send it a HFMN at all.

4. Moves

The moves are structured as so:

0 -- rock
1 -- paper
2 -- scissors

This is also known as the 'move ID'.

We send the server a JSON string formatted like this:

{'playerMove': 1, 'rpsSessionId': '[this is the session id we got earlier]'}

and we can receive one of 5 statuses:

1: this means your session expired. took too long.

7: You sent it too soon. Here to enforce the 30 second countdown.

8: Win. See chapter 5

9: Lose.

10: Tie.

5. Win & the key

You win once you get status 8 from above.
The JSON from before contains the following

{'responseCode': 8, 'magicLink': '[this is an HTML link to the unlock page]'}

You visit that page and you will unlock the file.

6. End

For now, that's all the knowledge I have of the API, and all of it
has been implemented on the Python program that should have been
provided with this document.
